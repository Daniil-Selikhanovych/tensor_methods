This set of codes excecutes studied tensor methods to the Logistic Regression Problem. 
The data are Covertype Dataset in the covtype.libsvm.binary.scale file (https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary/covtype.libsvm.binary.scale.bz2).
The main code is in LogisticRegression-Part1.ipynb and LogisticRegression-Part2.ipynb.
txt-files are f(x_k) data for tensors_logistic_loss_iter.pdf.
